This repository houses the code for a real-time e-commerce data pipeline built with Apache Kafka, Apache Flink, PostgreSQL, and Elasticsearch. Itâ€™s a hands-on project that processes streaming transaction data and delivers real-time analytics, all orchestrated with Docker Compose.

## Project Overview
The pipeline simulates e-commerce transactions, processes them in real-time, and stores the results for analysis and visualization. Key pieces include:  
- **Kafka**: Streams transaction data.  
- **Flink**: Processes streams, computing aggregates like sales by category or day.  
- **PostgreSQL**: Stores raw and processed data.  
- **Elasticsearch**: Indexes data for fast querying.  
- **Kibana**: Displays real-time dashboards.

## Features
- Real-time transaction processing.
- Scalable design for growing data loads.
- Interactive visualizations in Kibana.

## Code Structure
- `main.py`: Generates and sends transactions to Kafka.
- `DataStreamJob.java`: Flink logic for stream processing and sinks.
- `Dto/`: Data objects for transactions.
- `utils/`: Helpers for JSON and data handling.
- `Deserializer`: Deserialize streaming data from Kafka.
